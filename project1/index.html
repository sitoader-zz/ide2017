		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Visualization 1: <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/02/vocabulary/index.html"># of unique words used within artistâ€™s first 35,000 lyrics</a></dt>
			<dd>+ One can mouse over the artist and get the exact value of the unique words as it's difficult to know otherwise.</dd>
			<dd>+ The data is grouped via regions which also can be toggled and the colors are easily discernible so as to avoid confusion.</dd>
			<dd>- There is a lack of search function so one has to mouse over every bubble to know the name of the artist and the number of unique words as the pictures might not be recognized by everyone.</dd>
			<dt>Visualization 2: <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/snake-oil-scientific-evidence-for-nutritional-supplements-vizsweet/">Scientific evidence for popular health supplements</a></dt>
			<dd>+ Highly interactive visualization with clickable bubbles which provide more information. Also, there are filters to filter out the data visible.</dd>
			<dd>+ Ordered the bubbles from harmful to strong evidence support which conveys the message.</dd>
			<dd>- The visualization does not adapt to different display sizes so if the window is resized, the visualization is not fully displayed which is not ideal.</dd>
			<dd>- There is no search filter here as well, so one has to look through every bubble to find one that is required.</dd>

				An interesting interactive visualization would be displaying different genders of music and its most popular artists. When selecting on a gender, various specific musicians will come up. A correlation can be done by years, for example evolution during time. When choosing a musician, circles with songs pop up on the map.</p>
			<p>
				For this, data such as music genders, artists, songs and release year would be needed. Wikipedia provides lists with musicians and necesarry details could be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_musicians">here</a>. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_rock_artists">this link</a> provides all artists asociated with alternative rock. Gathering all the data would be time consuming, but once structured in a csv, visualization would not be so difficult.
			</p>
			<p>
				The intended audience would be quite broad, including everyone interested in music.

				A sketch/mockup of the visualization. </br>
				<a href="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/pack-hierarchy.html">This example</a> could be used as a starting point for the visualization where each gender would be represented by a big circle.

				I feel an interesting visualization would be visualizing the Education Statistics of the world.
			<p>
				For this, the data is already available at <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats"> The World Bank</a> which can be filtered using a very broad and flexible set of filters. Moreover, Google also provides access to this data using it's BigQuery API <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/world-bank-education">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The intended audience could be anyone who's interested in this data including statisticians intending to see how trends affect the various parameters and how they have changed over time. This can be combined with other data such as development index to see how education affects a country's overall growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't really have a particular style of visualization in mind given as there are so many filters to work through and different styles would be suitable for different combinations of data but I feel like this could be a very interesting dataset to work with.
